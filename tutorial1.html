    <h2 id="cv"> Comprehnsive Course Viva</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this Course viva is to ensure the basic knowledge of each student in the most
        fundamental core courses in the curriculum. The viva voce shall be conducted based on the core
        subjects studied from third to eighth semester. This course helps the learner to become competent in
        placement tests and other competitive examinations. <br><br>
        Guidelines <br>
        1. The course should be mapped with a faculty and classes shall be arranged for practicing
        questions based on the core courses listed in the curriculum. <br>
        2. The viva voce will be conducted by the same three member committee assigned for final
        project phase II evaluation. It comprises of Project coordinator, expert from
        Industry/research Institute and a senior faculty from a sister department. <br>
        3. The pass minimum for this course is 25. <br>
        4. The mark will be treated as internal and should be uploaded along with internal marks of
        other courses. <br>
        5. Comprehensive Viva should be conducted along with final project evaluation by the three
        member committee.

    <h2 id="pr2">Project 2</h2>
    <p>The course ‘Project Work’ is mainly intended to evoke the innovation and invention
        skills in a student. The course will provide an opportunity to synthesize and apply the knowledge
        and analytical skills learned, to be developed as a prototype or simulation. The project extends to
        2 semesters and will be evaluated in the 7th and 8th semester separately, based on the achieved
        objectives. One third of the project credits shall be completed in 7th semester and two third in 8th
        semester. It is recommended that the projects may be finalized in the thrust areas of the
        respective engineering stream or as interdisciplinary projects. Importance should be given to
        address societal problems and developing indigenous technologies. <br><br>
        Course Objectives <br>
         To apply engineering knowledge in practical problem solving. <br>
         To foster innovation in design of products, processes or systems. <br>
         To develop creative thinking in finding viable solutions to engineering problems.
